** Bank dan e-Money Indonesia Payment Gateway WooCommerce **
The WooCommerce Bank and e-Money Indonesia Payment Gateway plugin consists of several collections of banks and e-Money in Indonesia for WooCommerce payments. WooCommerce default provides only 1 bank transfer payment gateway for all your bank accounts. This plugin provides several Indonesian banks and e-Money (BCA, BNI, Mandiri, BRI, Jago, Dana, LinkAja, and many others) as payment methods for checkout at WooCommerce. There is a payment icon that can be activated and deactivated. In addition, there is a payment code to make it easier to check the transfer of consumer funds in the seller's account.
